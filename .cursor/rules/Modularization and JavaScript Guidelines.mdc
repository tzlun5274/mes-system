Modularization Principles
Independent Development and Access Restrictions:

Each functional module must be developed independently.

Cross-accessing unauthorized logic from other modules is strictly forbidden.

Inter-Module Communication:

Modules may only communicate through explicitly defined APIs.

Direct access to the internal implementation details of other modules is prohibited.

Shared Logic:

All shared logic must be extracted and centrally managed.

Shared logic should be placed in a services.py file or built as an independent shared module.

JavaScript Guidelines
Native JS First:

Only native JavaScript is permitted for development.

The use of any external libraries, including but not limited to jQuery, is strictly prohibited.

Modularization and Global Scope Isolation:

All JavaScript code must be modularized.

Polluting the global scope is strictly forbidden.

File Location:

Custom JavaScript files must be placed within the static/module_name/ directory.

module_name should be replaced with the corresponding functional module name.
